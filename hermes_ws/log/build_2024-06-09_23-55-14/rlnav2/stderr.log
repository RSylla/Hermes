[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnavigation2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "navigation2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "navigation2" with
  any of the following names:

    navigation2Config.cmake
    navigation2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "navigation2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "navigation2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "navigation2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
